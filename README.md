# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**Author:** Paras Agrawal  
**Live Demo:** [Sorting Algorithms Visualizer](https://parasagrawal1709.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/)  
**Source Code:** [Sorting Algorithms Visualizer Code](https://github.com/parasagrawal1709/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer)

## Overview

This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides an interactive way to visualize classic sorting algorithms, making it easier for beginners to understand the step-by-step process involved in sorting data. The visualizer not only serves as an educational tool but also as a project to improve and showcase web development skills.

## Purpose

The main goals of creating this visualizer were:
1. To deepen my understanding and skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
2. To provide a helpful resource for beginners in programming, enabling them to gain a clearer understanding of how different sorting algorithms work through visual demonstrations.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application currently supports visualizations for the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the advantage of being efficient for small data sets.
3. **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sort that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains a single element and then merges them back together in sorted order.
5. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parasagrawal1709/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Open the Index File:**

   Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Choose an Algorithm:**

   Use the user interface to select one of the sorting algorithms. You can then see the visual representation of how the algorithm sorts the data step-by-step.

## File Structure

The project is built in a single HTML file for simplicity. Below is a brief overview of the file structure:

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the page and the embedded JavaScript code responsible for the sorting algorithms and their visualizations.
- **styles.css**: Provides the CSS styling for the visualizer interface.
- **script.js**: Houses the JavaScript code that implements the sorting algorithms and the logic to visualize the sorting process.
